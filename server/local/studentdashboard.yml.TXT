# This is a fully commented yaml configuration file for Latte.  Real configuration
# contain values and far fewer comments.
#

### This yaml format file specifies configuration values that may change from
### instance to instance.  E.g. the values may need to be different between the
### developer, qa, and production instances.
### NOTE: White space indentation matters for yaml.

# ESB data provider: This is the name of the ESB "application" that identifies the
# credentials to be used for ESB oauth authentication.  It must match up with a
# corresponding application name in the security.yml file.
# See that file for details on the authentication information.
#application_name: SD-QA

# Text to return to the user when the query does make any sense to StudentDashboard.
#invalid_query_text: Come on, ask something reasonable

# The name to use when no user name is available.  This is primarily useful
# in test installations.
#default_user: anonymous

#### Default term to use for course lookups if no other information is available.
#default_term: 2020

# These values allow implementation of a stub authentication service (to be used
# primarily for load testing).
# The authn_uniqname_override value, when set to 'true', will allow the uniqname of the user
# may be taken from the URL UNIQNAME parameter.  When 'true' this will work for every user.
# It should only be true in test environments.
# E.g. localhost:3000/?UNIQNAME=bono with run StudentDashboard as if the user is bono.
#authn_uniqname_override: false
# The two "authn_wait_..." values give the range of time to wait between changing
# the user name and returning.  They are included so that the effect of a delay
# that would be caused by using an external authentication system can be
# modeled during load testing.

#authn_wait_min: 0.01
#authn_wait_max: 0.03

# The latte_admin_group specifies the name of a MCommunity group. The members
# of that group will have administrative access for Latte.  In particular they will
# be able to request information for people besides themselves. I.e. the
# UNIQNAME=<whoever> query parameter will always work for them.
#latte_admin_group: TL-Latte-admin-test

######### Data provider selection ###########
## Two data provider implementations are supplied:
## ESB - this is the default and all the configuration is in the security.yml file.
##        it is used unless the data_provider_file provider is configured below.
## FB (file based) - This is used only for testing and allows reading data
## from local files.  Configuration is documented below.

### file based data provider value configuration.
# This is the user used for the 'check' url processing.   It
# corresponds to a file in the courses directory.
#data_provider_file_uniqname: test-throttle-courses

# If data_file_provider_directory does have a value then Latte will treat
# the value as a directory name and will look there for files matching
# the request.  If the directory starts with
# a '/' it is taken as an absolute path.  Otherwise the base directory for
# application is prepended to the path.  It is able, for example, to look within
# the directory /usr/latte/really/good/directory or locally within the expanded war file.
#data_provider_file_directory: server/test-files
