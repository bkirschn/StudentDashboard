Repository for the Student Dashboard preliminary code.  It will be kept in github and will be public for the whole world to see forever.

Plan is to keep all the projects for this in the same repository even though the server and the UI will be worked on separately.
We'll need to merge / test frequently.

The server can be run by running the server/runServer.sh script.  It
currently provides both the data server and the UI.
